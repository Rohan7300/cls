Driver safety is important to us and we advise any driver that is threatened with violence for their vehicle and its contents to walk away from your vehicle and if your keys are taken to contact OSM immediately and contact the police and report the incident.\nPlease remember that mistakes mean £££ when not wearing your key chain.
